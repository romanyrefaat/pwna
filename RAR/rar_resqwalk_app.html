        <h4>What is ResQWalk?</h4>
        <p>
            ResQwalk is a smart-phone mobile app that enables animal lovers to raise money for animal rescues and shelters in the United States and Canada every time they go for a walk.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each week, ResQwalk announces a donation pool (e.g. $2,500). In order for a rescue to receive donations from the pool, its supporters simply need to check into the app when they go for a walk (with a dog, alone, or with a friend). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each walker's distance is recorded and added to the rescue's weekly sum. At the end of the week donations are paid out to the rescues proportionally to the total distance walked.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>What else does ResQWalk do?</h4>
        <p>
            Other cool features of the app include: prizes at the end of each walk, a news section with pet-related content, a shop section with product deals and offers, and profile pages for users and rescues to track both miles walked and dollars raised.
