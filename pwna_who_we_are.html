            PWNA has served Native Americans for nearly 25 years. We are the only Native-serving charity to work on about 65 reservations year-round.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much of our work centers around material aid, educational support and onsite services that afford immediate relief to economically-depressed reservations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our service area is concentrated in nine <a href="#">priority states</a> that encompass Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Navajo and more than 60 other reservations with a high need for basic necessities.

        <h2>More a Partnership Than a Charity</h2>
        <p>
            We have a strong network of over 1,000 partnerships with reservation programs. We work through these partners to bring much-needed relief to 250,000 Native Americans.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our partnerships reach into remote reservation communities that most Americans never see and most organizations cannot reach — whether due to geography, a need for reservation contacts or cultural competency, or a lack of information about specific needs.</li>
            <li>We operate a highly efficient warehouse and distribution system that lets us truck over 5 million pounds of materials to our reservation partners each year.</li>
            <li>Our partners ensure goods make their way directly into the hands of the people who need them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            PWNA’s approach brings several other <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_strengths">important benefits</a> to those who work with us. The fact that our Program Partners are Native Americans who live and work on the reservations gives us added insights on how to work effectively on the reservations. Their <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_partner_successes">success stories</a> reflect their dedication.
        </p>
        <p>Our partnerships also helped us evolve "<a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_way">The PWNA Way</a>" and our guiding principles of stewardship, volunteerism, and respect.</p>
        <h4>How you can help</h4>
        <p>To make a difference in such a wide service area, PWNA relies on the generosity of concerned Americans as well as businesses that are able to make grants or donate goods in bulk. We deliver the donated and purchased goods to our reservation Program Partners, who distribute the goods in their communities.</p>
        <p>Typically, product donations take the form of basic necessities, which are much needed in our remote communities. PWNA covers any cost of shipping the goods from wherever they are to our distribution center in South Dakota or Arizona. Monetary donations help us purchase similar goods at volume discounts and transport the goods to the reservations.</p>
        <p>Both monetary and product donations increase the quality and quantity of goods that PWNA provides and support a greater impact on quality of life for the Native Americans we serve.</p>
