            Imagine trying to survive the winter in a house where it’s nearly as cold indoors as out. On remote reservations of the Southwest, where there are acute housing shortages and inadequate tribal funds for home improvements, many Elders face this challenge. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Council of Indian Nations program addresses this problem through its Weatherization and Home Safety Improvement service. One of SWRA’s oldest and most ambitious services, Weatherization and Home Safety aims to provide warm, safe homes for Elders. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The SWRA program leads teams of community members and volunteers to weatherproof Elders’ homes by replacing flimsy doors, broken windows, dilapidated roofing, and cracked flooring. The Weatherization and Home Safety Improvement program also helps make homes safer for Elders by installing safety equipment such as grab bars and ramps. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In keeping with our mission to help Native American people improve the quality of their lives, volunteer community members are deeply involved in selecting Elders in need of this program. The members are responsible for completing all paperwork, evaluating the level of repairs needed in each home, overseeing the work, and carrying out the repairs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2008, SWRA services helped ensure over 50 Elders had a warmer and safer home last winter as well as distributed over 460 emergency kits to Elders in seven communities.

    <h4>Weatherization and Home Safety Story</h4>
    <p>
        Deserving Elders across the Navajo Nation have warmer houses this winter thanks to SWRA’s Weatherization and Home Safety service.  One year, a project in Kaibeto, Arizona mobilized dozens of dedicated and skilled volunteers. During an intense week of work up on roofs and down in the dirt these volunteers fixed roofs, windows, siding and safety features for a number of houses. Many of the volunteer workers had professional building skills, so the repairs were solid and long-lasting. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Volunteers fixed a badly leaking roof on the octagon house of Romeo and Bernice Franklin. The Franklins, who are elderly and both are hard of hearing, also got a new concrete pad by their front door to help them get in and out of their house safely. Other volunteers replaced substandard roof tiles and a rear door on the house of Ray and Lillie Tsinnijinne, and built a concrete ramp to the front door of Lille Begay's home. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of this intense week, volunteers were given incentive items provided by SWRA. Incentives included desperately needed items such as shoes, work jackets and coveralls, personal care items, diapers and toys for children. For these volunteer workers and the Elders they helped, SWRA’s Weatherization and Home Safety service is a win-win situation.
