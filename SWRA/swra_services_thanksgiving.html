            Our Thanksgiving service, perhaps the most joyous of all SWRA’s services, helps ensure that Thanksgiving is truly a festive day for young and old alike who live on the rural and remote reservations of the Southwest.

        <p>
            In the spirit of the holiday, Program Partners and volunteers take on the responsibility for preparing turkey and all the trimmings for Elders and their families at community centers in Native American communities. Most of the time, these families simply could not afford to celebrate Thanksgiving without the help of the SWRA program. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For homebound Elders and their families, we provide Thanksgiving food boxes filled with a large turkey, vegetables, stuffing, cranberries and that most anticipated of holiday treats, a pumpkin pie. Volunteers then deliver these holiday food boxes, which often involves driving long distances across the roughest of roads. In the small community Cibecue, Arizona, for example, the SWRA program was able to provide a complete Thanksgiving dinner to many families last year. As one happy Cibecue resident put it, "[m]any people drop off things, but this is a first with the turkey and the works!"
        </p>

            For Thanksgiving 2008, the SWRA program helped distribute over 2,700 family meal boxes, providing meals for over 16,000 people.
