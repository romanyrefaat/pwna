        <h2>The Talent Behind the Brand</h2>
        <p>
            The talent behind the PWNA brand is an integral part of our continued success with both Program Partners and donors. Our core values stress that “our employees are the source of our strength.” We could not do what we do without their passion and caring hearts for making a difference in Indian country.
        </p>
        <p>PWNA employees often possess a passion for our mission, a recognition of the injustices in American Indian history, an awareness that American Indians are underserved in the US, and enthusiasm, professionalism, and solid skills in their field or specialization.</p>
        <u>What some staffers say about working at Partnership with Native Americans:</u>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“I like the way we support the reservation’s self-determined goals. We don’t tell anyone what to do or how to do it. Many have done that before — it got American Indians to the conditions we see today.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“I like coming to work and knowing that I make a difference every day. Knowing that it helps someone who is Native American is even better.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“The injustices suffered by American Indians and what was taken can never be repaid. At least now I can help give something back.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“At Partnership with Native Americans, I get to do what I love and be the best I can be! That keeps me going.”</p>
