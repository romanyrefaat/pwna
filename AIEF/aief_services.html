            <strong>
                Up to 43 percent of Native American children live in poverty and 29 percent of employed Native Americans live below poverty level.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout our country, Native American children travel each day for hours across rugged and remote areas to attend school. These students often lack the simplest tools — such as paper, pencils, and notebooks — needed to participate in class. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Years of struggle take their toll on students. Today, only 17% of Native American high school graduates begin college. Of these, only one in five makes it through the academic, emotional, and financial stresses of the first year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, like all our children, these youngsters are inspired by the dream of a better future. Since 1997, the American Indian Education Fund (AIEF) has given hope to Native American students by providing the tools they need to succeed!
