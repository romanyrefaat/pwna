<h1>Success Stories</h1>
<p>
    American Indian Education Fund Program’s success stories allow us to show our donors how the services they support help real students in real communities on reservations throughout the United States.
</p>
<p>
    We hope that by sharing stories of these dedicated Native Americans, along with pictures of them and their communities, we will open a window into the lives of students on the reservations. We want to show all those who care about Indian people that together we are achieving our mission: "To give Native American students the tools, resources, and opportunities to learn and succeed. By harnessing the power of knowledge, these future leaders can work to bring about positive changes in their own lives and their communities."
