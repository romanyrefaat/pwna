                Reservation Animal Rescue, a program of PWNA, helps partners rescue hungry or injured stray animals and stop the spread of disease.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For centuries, dogs have played an important role within many Native American cultures. Their responsibilities often included hunting, guarding, even pulling travois (sleds.) These valued animals were an integral member of the tribe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Native American people continue to love and value their dogs and cats as much as you do. Unfortunately, many residents living on reservations face extreme poverty, limited access to medical care and few educational opportunities. They often lack the resources to manage the stray dog and cat population and care for orphaned animals on the reservation.
        </p>
        <p>
            With assistance from our supporters and Program Partners, we care for dogs and cats with food, blankets, toys and treats. The importance of getting them healthy cannot be over-emphasized. They need homes — as many wonderful, loving homes for them as possible!
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to providing basic supplies for their care, we also help fund mobile spay and neuter clinics, care for stray and orphaned animals ... place them in foster care ... and get them ready for adoption into loving homes — where they belong!
