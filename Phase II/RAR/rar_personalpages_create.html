            <p>
                <strong>1. What are Personal Sage Pages?</strong><br>
                Personal Sage Pages are an opportunity for all animal-lovers to celebrate and 
                share the humor, love, and wisdom our pets shower upon us every day.  Each page 
                includes a place for your pet's personal story, photos, a personal fundraising 
                goal, progress towards the goal and a guest book with notes of encouragement 
                from supporters.  You can also encourage donations to help homeless animals on American Indian reservations.

                programs wherever the need is greatest.
