            Native Americans have long honored the wisdom animals provide for our lives. As an animal-lover, you have experienced this for yourself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            RAR Sage Pages allow you to create and personalize your own web page to honor the animal wisdom in your life, sharing their pictures and stories — have fun with it! 
        </p>
        <p>
            In their honor, you can also help raise funds for animals needing assistance on reservations. Check out other pages as examples or learn more about traditional Native American animal wisdom.
