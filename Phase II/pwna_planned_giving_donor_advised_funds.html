        <p>
            Most of our donors contribute directly to our organization and work with us when planning bequeaths through <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_planned_giving_life_insurance">life insurance</a>, <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_planned_giving_retirement">retirement</a>, or <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_planned_giving_bequests">estate planning</a>. If you prefer, another way to help is by designating [[S80:sitename]] (<span class="text-uppercase">[[S80:prefix]]</span>) as a charity you want to support through a donor-advised fund.
        </p>
        <p>
            [[S80:sitename]] works directly with community-based agencies on the reservations. Our partnerships ensure that we are providing the right kind of support &#8212; food, health, education or housing related. We work on the ground throughout the year to help close the gap on the pervasive needs of these hardworking communities in tough circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Help is needed for the <strong>short-term</strong> to supply material aid and relief efforts, for the <strong>mid-term</strong> to ensure capacity building such as scholarships and partner training, and for the <strong>long-term</strong> to support grassroots sustainable solutions such as community gardens, farmer&#8217;s markets, and winter fuel projects.
        </p>
