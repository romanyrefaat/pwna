            Education is one of the most important cornerstones of self-sufficiency and quality of life. It is also a crucial factor in addressing the long-term poverty and other challenges on the reservations we serve. Our education services assist Native American students from pre-kindergarten to high school. (See Higher Education for college services.)

            We also support literacy for Native youth, providing supplies and incentives to encourage parent-child reading time. By addressing both immediate and long-term educational needs, PWNA helps our partner schools and colleges motivate students and retention.
