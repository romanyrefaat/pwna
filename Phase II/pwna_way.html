        <p>We call the principles that guide our work &#8220;The PWNA  Way,&#8221; meaning:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA works with reservation Program Partners who identify the needs in their communities that we can help them address.</strong><br/>
            We provide goods and services to our partners and work with them to plan and implement distributions and activities in their communities. This helps reduce the immediate need.

        <p> 
            <strong>PWNA helps Program Partners enhance the reservation programs where they work.</strong><br/>
            By volunteering with PWNA, the partners learn how to work with outside resources, organize and advertise events, and recruit and coordinate volunteers. Their volunteers also build skills and confidence. This learning benefits reservation programs in the long run.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA gives preference to rural and remote communities with limited access to transportation and services.</strong><br/>
            Many who live on reservations reside in rural areas far away from health care, stores, schools, or employment opportunities. They also lack the transportation needed to get to the nearest town or facility. These are the areas PWNA prioritizes for service.
        </p>
        <table width="200" border="0" align="right" cellPadding="3" cellSpacing="0">             <tr>            <td><div style="float: right; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/content/pagebuilder/CIP.jpg"  alt="Native American Elder and child in a community garden"></div></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="photo" align="center">Generations benefit from community gardens.<br /><br /></td>          </tr>            </table>        
        <p>
            <strong>When a group is selected for service, PWNA strives to serve everyone in the group.</strong><br/>
            In addition to need, a group may be further defined by age, location, the Partner&#8217;s service area, or other factors. These criteria make clear who is to receive the service. Using this system helps to avoid any feeling of unfairness or partiality within the community &#8212; feelings that could undermine the effectiveness and credibility of PWNA or its Program Partners.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA delivers only needed goods and services.</strong><br/>
            We work with Program Partners to understand what products are needed and in what quantities, then strive to match those needs with high-quality products. In other words, we do not "dump and run." Dumping goods merely because they are available doesn&#8217;t guarantee a benefit. Some goods are unwanted or inappropriate, and this varies by community.
        </p>
        <p>Delivering the wrong thing at the wrong time or to the wrong place can create a problem for the community. Thus, PWNA only delivers to our reservation partners and only delivers goods that the partners say will help.</p>

        <table width="200" border="0" align="right" cellPadding="3" cellSpacing="0">             <tr>            <td><div style="float: right; padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="../images/content/pagebuilder/AIEF-School-Supplies.jpg"  alt="Native American Elder and child in a community garden"></div></td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="photo" align="center">No paper or pencils? PWNA helps students succeed.<br /><br /></td>          </tr>            </table>        
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA insists upon program accountability.</strong><br/>
            We expect our Program Partners to care as much about the goods and services provided as we do. Goods and services must go only to the defined group and be reported on by the partners in a timely fashion. We fulfill our obligations to our Program Partners, and we expect our Program Partners to fulfill their obligations to us.
        </p>
        <p>We clearly outline expectations as to what a Program Partner needs to do and what PWNA will do for them. Building this line of communication makes PWNA services more effective because everyone&#8217;s expectations are clear.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA is also accountable to its donors.</strong><br/>
            We take seriously the management of resources that donors entrust to our care. We work efficiently and effectively year-round to achieve the maximum reach and impact from available resources. This enables PWNA to be a consistent resource to Indian country and to the partners who are counting on us.
