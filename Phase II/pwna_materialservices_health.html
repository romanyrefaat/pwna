<h1>Native Americans suffer from higher infant mortality, lower life expectancy, diabetes at epidemic levels, and cancer-related disparities higher than any minority group in the U.S</h1>

            Our health services support reservation programs that address preventative care, home health visits and health education initiatives for tribal members and motivate healthy involvement in community service. The people PWNA serves on remote and isolated reservations rely on limited Indian Health Services (IHS) for medical care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transportation is a major problem because of the long distances to clinics and the lack of transportation. Severely underfunded and understaffed for the size and location of the populations it serves, IHS focuses on healthcare crises rather than preventive care. (Related programs: American Indian Relief Council (AIRC), Council of Indian Nations (CIN), Native American Aid (NAA), Navajo Relief Fund (NRF), Sioux Nation Relief Fund (SNRF) and Southwest Indian Relief Council (SWIRC).)
