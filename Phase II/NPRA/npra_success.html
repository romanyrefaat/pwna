<h1>Success Stories</h1>
<p>
    The Northern Plains Reservation Aid (NPRA) Program’s success stories allow us to show our donors how the services they support help real children, families, and Elders living in real communities on reservations throughout the Northern Plains.
</p>
<p>
    We hope that by sharing stories of these dedicated Native Americans, along with pictures of them and their communities, we will open a window into their lives on the reservations. We want to show all those who care about Indian people that together we are achieving our mission: “Serving immediate needs. Supporting long-term solutions.”
