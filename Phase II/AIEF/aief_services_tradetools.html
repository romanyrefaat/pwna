            <em>Native American students in health fields may need specific tools to complete their coursework.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to assist Native American students to begin their school year successfully, students may need specific tools (other than textbooks), to complete their coursework.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AIEF Program partners with post secondary schools* offering the opportunity to apply for a competitive grant. This grant would assist students in obtaining “tools for learning” that they may need and cannot afford.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tools are defined as supplies individual students may need to assist them with completing coursework. If students do not complete their coursework, relevant tools are to be left with the sponsoring school for other students to utilize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting with 2015, only one application is needed to cover the tools for either health or building trades.<br/>
