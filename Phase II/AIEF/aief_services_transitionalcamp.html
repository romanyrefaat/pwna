            <em>The purpose of this service is to support and “Motivate to Graduate” students, increase retention in schools, assist in transitioning from high school to college, and offer other career alternatives to students.</em>

            Like all students, Native American college freshmen must adjust to life on campus, the difference between high school and college classrooms, and being away from their families.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet unlike other students, many Native students must also adjust to life off of the reservation. This is a huge transition that encompasses cultural, spiritual, emotional, as well as economic and lifestyle shifts that far exceed what non-Native students face. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The American Indian Education Foundation (AIEF) Program desires to see an increase in Native American students graduating from high school and completing college and vocational programs. To facilitate these positive changes, we partner with post secondary schools* offering them the opportunity to apply for a competitive grant.
