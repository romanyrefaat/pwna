            How can you comfort a scared girl or boy in a frightening or tragic situation? The simple but brilliant solution: with a lovable, huggable stuffed toy.

            SWRA’s Hug-a-Bear service provides comfort to Native American children who have been involved in a traumatic situation. Thanks to donations of stuffed animals from SWRA donors from across the country, the Hug-a-Bear program distributes stuffed animals each year to a growing number of police, fire, and emergency medical services on reservations throughout the Southwest.

        <p>
            These emergency personnel distribute the stuffed animals to children distressed by accidents, illness or other traumas in their environment.

            Reservation firefighters and police enthusiastially support the Hug-a-Bear service because it helps calm the child and creates a positive image in the community for emergency and police services. Reservation police in particular find that the service helps police establish a more trusting relationship with the children and their parents. One officer even told us that he keeps a big teddy bear in the back seat of his police car.  No matter how traumatic the situation, emergency personnel have found that a simple stuffed animal provides a powerful sense of comfort and security to children. A paramedic for the Barona Fire Protection District shared with us that “[t]his is a program every department should participate in.”
