            A charitable gift annuity is an agreement under which a charity, in return for a transfer of cash from a donor, agrees to pay a fixed amount of money to that donor, for their lifetime. The PWNA annuity product requires a donation gift of $20,000 or more. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Through PWNA’s investment of these funds, a donor will not only receive a steady stream of calculated quarterly payments for their lifetime, but they also can reduce their overall annual tax bill? However, this win-win also benefits PWNA in that we have a portion of the donor’s gift that can be used immediately for our programs.
