            Our <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/report/chartingimpact/575773695/national-relief-charities.pdf" target="_blank">Program Logic Model</a> is set up to illustrate the change for our reservation partners. The logic model shows that, as reservation partners become more effective, they are more likely to create positive impact for their communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            This moves us toward our vision of strong, self-sufficient Native American  communities, and it underscores the need for NRC to maintain long-term relationships, high customer satisfaction and continuous feedback from our partners. <a href="DocServer/2013_Effectiveness_Report.pdf?docID=4983">Download the Effectiveness Report (PDF)</a>

<p>
    Collaborating with our Material Services partners, PWNA provides essential supplies and seasonal services for Northern Plains and Southwest reservations, education and animal welfare. Yet, even while meeting immediate needs, we are having a long-term impact. 
</p>
<p>
    Each year, PWNA sends an anonymous survey to our entire base of 1,000+ Program Partners: we want to learn about the gains they have made by working with us. Our annual survey response rate is higher than 50% and the results show that PWNA has a positive impact on our partners and their ability to better serve their communities, as our graphic shows.

    PWNA’s long-term services are designed to support the self-determined initiatives of reservation partners and other local leaders who are working for sustainable gains in their communities. While our Long-Term Solutions are relatively new offerings, they are already yielding positive outcomes for partners, participants and communities on the reservations.
