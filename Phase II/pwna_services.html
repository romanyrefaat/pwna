        <p>
            PWNA serves 60 reservations in 11 priority states throughout the Northern Plains and Southwest regions of the United States. We focus on underserved and geographically-isolated Native American communities with limited employment opportunities, addressing both immediate needs and working towards long-term solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We build upon assets within the communities we serve, bringing together individuals, programs and outside resources to address challenges and support positive change. This community-driven model leverages the social capital of a larger network mobilizing toward a common solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are six major program categories through which we provide materials for immediate needs, as shown on our Form 990.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like our Material Services, Long-Term Solutions are critical to our vision of strong, self-sufficient Native American communities and support the self-determined initiatives of reservation partners and other local leaders who are working for sustainable gains in their communities. While some of PWNA’s long-term services are new, they are already yielding positive outcomes for partners, participants and communities on the reservations.
