    <p><em>“I received the very lovely framed certificate.  It really wasn't necessary as I give without expecting anything in return.  Since I haven't decided where to display it yet, it is currently sitting in a place of honor, on my kitchen island where I can look at it multiple times during the day.  When someone comes to visit me, they will also see it and then I will tell them just how important it is to donate."</em></p>
