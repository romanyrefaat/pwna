<h1>Nearly one in four (23%) Native American households experience low food security, meaning not enough food quality, variety, or desirability of dietary intake</h1>

            Our Food & Water services ease food insecurity among Native American Elders, children and families. Because low food security is an everyday issue on the reservations PWNA serves, nutrition-related disease rates are high. Contaminated drinking water is also an issue in many of the communities we serve. Although many food banks operate within our service area, a study by America's Second Harvest shows that the majority of food banks lack an adequate supply of food to meet demand.
