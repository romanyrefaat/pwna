    As a member of The Heritage Circle, you will be periodically informed on our efforts to provide services to American Indians living in need in the areas we serve. You will receive a beautiful framed certificate acknowledging your admission into The Heritage Circle.
</p>
<p>
    Your framed certificate is a token of our sincere appreciation, in honor of your legacy gift to Indian People. This gift will incorporate a highly stylized medicine wheel. In its design, the wheel is divided into four sections, which signifies the four directions of north, south, east and west.
</p>
<p>
    The colors stand for the four races of man and the circle design symbolizes the circle of life. We included the feathers in the design to embody the strength, pride and independence the eagle has held in many American Indian cultures.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions regarding planned giving, please contact our Suzi Smith in the Planned Giving Department at (877) 853-6474.  Or, you can <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_planned_giving_information_request">request more information</a> online by submitting this form.  You are also encouraged to consult with your legal and financial advisors when considering a planned gift.
