            Cash from individual donors and gift-in-kind contributions from corporations make up the majority of Partnership With Native Americans’ revenue.  We are always humbled at the generosity of our donors and partners and the loyalty they show to the work we do in Indian country.  We are finding that more and more of our donors are interested in other means of giving and are leveraging their ownership of stock and securities to help fund PWNA’s mission.

            Giving stock, instead of cash, as a donation can greatly benefit both the individual donor and a charity.  If the stock the donor is contributing has increased in value from the time of purchase, the donor may avoid paying the capital gains tax by donating the security directly to PWNA. The total value of stock that is being donated may still be eligible for a tax deduction.

            Donors who are interested in a PWNA charitable gift annuity but who may not have the cash readily available to fund it, can also donate stock to fund an annuity.  This may allow for a double tax benefit.  (This is also an especially great option for donors if they have owned their stock for more than 366 days.)  Stocks that might not be paying the desired dividends can fund an annuity that may have larger annuity payments than the previous dividends.  Reinvestment of the stock into an annuity may also allow the charitable deduction to be claimed in the year the agreement is funded.  Secondly, a portion of the capital gains from the sale of the stock may be included in the overall deduction amount while the remaining is spread out over the donor’s life expectancy instead of being subject to taxation all at once.
