            Partnership With Native Americans is a 501c3 nonprofit organization committed to championing hope for a brighter future for Native Americans living on remote, isolated and impoverished reservations. Collaborating for 25 years with our reservation partners, we provide consistent aid and services for Native Americans with the highest need in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much of our work centers around material aid, educational support and community-based services. PWNA also connects outside resources directly to reservations through its distribution network and reservation partnerships. We care about quality of life for Native Americans and respect their self-determined goals for their tribes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only Native-serving charity to work on 60 reservations year-round, our service area is concentrated in 11 <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna&page=press_service">priority states</a> and encompasses Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Navajo and other high-need reservations.

            <p>Here are the principles that guide our work:</p>
            <p>1. PWNA works through reservation Partners, who identify the needs in their communities that PWNA can help them address. These are our Program Partners. We provide goods and services to the Partners, and work with them to plan and implement distributions and activities in their communities. This helps reduce the immediate need.</p>
            <p>2. PWNA helps Program Partners enhance the reservation programs where they work. By volunteering with NRC, the Partners learn how to work with outside resources, organize and advertise events, and recruit and coordinate volunteers. Their volunteers also build skills and confidence. This learning benefits reservation programs in the long run.</p>

<h2>More a Partnership Than a Charity</h2>
<p>
    PWNA has a strong network of more than 1,000 partnerships with reservation programs (our Program Partners). We work through these partners to bring much-needed relief to 250,000 Native Americans each year.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>PWNA partnerships reach into remote reservation communities that most Americans never see and most organizations cannot reach — whether due to geography, a need for reservation contacts or cultural competency, or a lack of information about specific needs.</li>
    <li>We operate a highly efficient warehouse and distribution system that lets us truck over 5 million pounds of materials to our reservation partners each year.</li>
    <li>PWNA’s reservation partners ensure goods make their way directly into the hands of the people who need them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    PWNA’s approach brings several other <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_strengths">important benefits</a> to those who work with us. The fact that our Program Partners are Native Americans who live and work on the reservations gives us added insights on how to work effectively on the reservations. Their <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna&page=stories">success stories</a> reflect their dedication. 
</p>
<p>Through our partnerships over the years, we evolved "<a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_way">The PWNA Way</a>" and our guiding principles of stewardship, volunteerism, and respect.</p>
<h4>How you can help</h4>
<p>To make a difference in such a wide service area, PWNA relies on the generosity of concerned Americans as well as corporations and foundations that are able to make grants or donate goods in bulk. We deliver the donated and purchased goods to our reservation Program Partners, who distribute the goods in their communities.</p>
<p>Typically, product donations take the form of basic necessities, which are much needed in our remote communities. PWNA covers any cost of shipping the goods from wherever they are to our distribution center in South Dakota or Arizona. Monetary donations help us purchase similar goods at volume discounts and transport the goods to the reservations.</p>
<p>Both monetary and product donations increase the quality and quantity of goods that PWNA provides and support a greater impact on quality of life for the Native Americans we serve.</p>
