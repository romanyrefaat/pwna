<h1>Up to 23% of Native American families live with low food security, and nutrition-related disease is disproportionately higher than other Americans</h1>

        <p>
            American Indian families are more threatened by low food security than other families in the U.S., and they experience the highest rate of diabetes. In addition, suicide rates for American Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 are 3 times the national average — and the second leading cause of death for their age group. PWNA’s Community Investment Projects support community champions who lead grassroots projects in reservation communities. These projects aim to positively impact the lives of tribal members and to deliver some type of sustainable gain for Native communities.

            <strong>Our Community Investment Projects typically involve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>nutrition and health projects related to food sovereignty</li>
                <li>youth development</li>
                <li>emergency preparedness</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Our community investment projects are longer term in nature and involve tracking outcomes over a period of 6 months to 3 years. For samples of our Long-Term Solutions projects, see our <a href="DocServer/Annual_Report.pdf?docID=1421">Annual Report</a>.
