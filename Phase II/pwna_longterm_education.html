<h1>Only 17% of Native American students start college and only 11% complete college</h1>

            Many Native students believe college is not an option for them and, contrary to public perception, college is not free for Native Americans. PWNA’s Higher Education Services increase college access and retention for Native American students.
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <strong>Our Higher Education services assist more than 350 Native students each year.</strong>

        <p>
            PWNA provides scholarships to undergraduate and graduate Native American students. We focus on applicants who are most often in the middle range of the academic ranking but who have serious drive and a demonstrated ability to overcome obstacles. (Related programs: American Indian Education Foundation)

        We also:
        <ul>
            <li>
                support transition camps to motivate a college mindset and prepare Native students for freshmen year
            </li>
            <li>
                make grants to tribal colleges, universities, and other groups committed to Native American education and increasing retention and funding for Native students
