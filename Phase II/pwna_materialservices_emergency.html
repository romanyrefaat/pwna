<h1>When the January 21, 2010 blizzard caused a state of emergency for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the news and call for help did not reach mainstream media until 11 days later. This is often a common occurrence when disaster strikes the reservations</h1>

            Our Emergency Services provide disaster relief for tribes and seasonal weatherization and housing assistance for Native American Elders. The physical environment on the reservations we support is often harsh, giving rise to a wide range of environmental disasters such as floods, forest fires, blizzards, ice storms, tornados and hurricanes. When disaster assistance is needed, NRC is quick to respond to the tribes in and beyond our normal service area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some communities also experience acute or chronic contaminated-water emergencies. In addition, 90,000 Native Americans are homeless and 40% of Native Americans live in sub-standard, overcrowded housing and the typical wait time for tribal housing assistance is three years or more.
        </p>
        <p>
            PWNA also rotates our winter readiness and housing services to different communities in the Plains and Southwest. Due to the expense and logistics, we are unable to offer these services to all reservations. We also assist homeless shelters and other residential facilities on the reservations we serve.
