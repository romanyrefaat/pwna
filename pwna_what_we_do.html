        <p>PWNA serves 65 reservations in 11 states throughout the Northern Plains and Southwest regions of the United States. We focus on underserved and geographically-isolated Native American communities with limited employment opportunities, addressing both immediate needs and working towards long-term solutions.</p>
        <p>We build upon assets within the communities we serve, bringing together individuals, programs and outside resources to address challenges and support positive change. This community-driven model leverages the social capital of a larger network mobilizing toward a common solution.</p>

                <h4>Education</h4>
                <p><em>High school dropout rates range from 30 to 70% on the reservations.</em></p>
                <p>Education is one of the most important cornerstones of self-sufficiency and quality of life. It is also a crucial factor in addressing the long-term poverty and other challenges on the reservations we serve.</p>
                <p><strong>PWNA furnishes essential school supplies for more than 44,000 K-12 students on 25+ reservations.</strong></p>
                <p>We also support literacy for Native youth, providing supplies and incentives to encourage parent-child reading time. By addressing both immediate and long-term educational needs, PWNA helps our partner schools and colleges motivate students and retention.</p>

                <h4>Health</h4>
                <p><em>Native Americans suffer from higher infant mortality, lower life expectancy, diabetes at epidemic levels, and cancer-related disparities higher than any minority group in the U.S.</em></p>
                <p>The people PWNA serves on remote and isolated reservations rely on limited Indian Health Services (IHS) for medical care. Transportation is a major problem because of the long distances to clinics and the lack of transportation. Severely underfunded and understaffed for the size and location of the populations it serves, IHS focuses on healthcare crises rather than preventive care. PWNA supports reservation programs that address preventative and long-term healthcare needs.</p>
                <strong>The healthy lifestyle programs offered by our reservation partners and supported by PWNA serve 250,000 Native Americans each year through:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>health screenings for diabetes, high blood pressure, tuberculosis and cancer,</li>
                    <li>education classes on diabetes prevention,</li>
                    <li>immunizations, pre- and post-natal care,</li>

                <p><em>Nearly one in four (23%) Native American households experience low food security, meaning not enough food quality, variety, or desirability of dietary intake.</em></p>
                <p>Low food security is an everyday issue on the reservations PWNA serves, nutrition-related disease rates are high. Contaminated drinking water is also an issue in many of the communities we serve. Although many food banks operate within our service area, a study by America's Second Harvest shows that the majority of food banks lack an adequate supply of food to meet demand.</p>
                <strong>PWNA helps meet immediate nutritional needs for 195,000 people each year by:</strong>
                <ul>

                <p>PWNA’s Holiday services help our reservation partners spread community cheer and participation at times when many families are experiencing more stress and disenfranchisement.</p>
                <p><strong>We provide holiday gift stockings for nearly 70,000 children, teens and Elders during the Christmas holiday season.</strong></p>
                <p>These stockings are filled with practical items to meet immediate needs. In addition, children and families receive incentives and prizes when they come together to participate in spring, Easter and other community gatherings. These types of holiday events also help partners and local volunteers develop skills for future event planning and community service.</p>

                <p>A long history of oppression has contributed to the limited view of opportunities many Native Americans envision for themselves and their families. Our Community Support services help reservation partners motivate involvement in community service, and to support programs concerned with animal welfare on the reservations.</p>
                <strong>Our community services benefit more than 114,000 Native Americans as well as animals under our reservation partners’ care, by:</strong>

                <p><em>40% of Native Americans live in sub-standard, overcrowded housing and the typical wait time for tribal housing assistance is three years or more.</em></p>
                <p>The physical environment on the reservations we support is often harsh, giving rise to a wide range of environmental disasters such as floods, forest fires, blizzards, ice storms, tornados and hurricanes. Some communities also experience acute or chronic contaminated-water emergencies.</p>
                <p>Our Emergency Services provide disaster relief for tribes and seasonal weatherization and housing assistance for Native American Elders.</p>
                <p>As a first responder, PWNA also provides immediate disaster relief for tribal members who are displaced due to blizzards, hurricanes, floods, and contaminated water emergencies. We also offers seasonal support to selected reservation communities based on need. Due to the expense and logistics, we are unable to offer these services to all reservations. We also rotate these services to different communities to avoid creating dependency.</p>
                <strong>Our Emergency Services benefit nearly 54,000 people a year through:</strong>
                <ul>

                    <li>repairing homes that run significant risk for vulnerable Elders.</li>
                    <li>replacing windows, adding ramps for wheelchair access and weatherizing homes for the winter,</li>

        <p>Long-Term Solutions are critical to our vision of strong, self-sufficient Native American communities.</p>
        <p>Our long-term services are designed to support the self-determined initiatives of reservation partners and other local leaders who are working for sustainable gains in their communities. While our Long-Term Solutions are PWNA’s newest services, they are already yielding positive outcomes for partners, participants and communities on the reservations.</p>

                <p>Many Native students believe college is not an option for them and, contrary to public perception, college is not free for Native Americans.</p>
                <p>PWNA’s Higher Education Services increase college access and retention for Native American students.</p>
                <p><strong>Our Higher Education services assist more than 500 Native students each year.</strong></p>

                <h4>Capacity Building</h4>
                <p>Pilot testing of our new and improved partner training is underway — it is unlike any offered in Indian country. This new training is a direct result of feedback from our reservation partners about needs and next steps that will help them be more effective. PWNA has been testing and revamping our training service with reservation partners since 2012.</p>
                <p>Currently, our Capacity Building program includes one service: the Four Directions Program (4D). This training is designed around a six-month program, with partners committing to personal and professional development goals and working with mentors for support in attaining their goals. Our first cohort is completes training in the spring. PWNA will track and report the progress of the participating partners for up to three years after program completion.</p>
                <p>PWNA is expanding Capacity Building services in 2015 for both Southwest and Northern Plains reservations.</p>

                <p>Some 23% of American Indian households experience low food insecurity, more so than other families in the US. For Native Americans, the rate of diabetes is the highest in the U.S. In addition, suicide rates for American Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 are 3 times the national average — and the second leading cause of death for their age group.</p>
                <p>PWNA’s Community Investment Projects support community champions who lead grassroots projects in reservation communities. These projects aim to positively impact the lives of tribal members and to deliver some type of sustainable gain for Native communities.</p>
                Our Community Investment Projects typically involve:
                <ul>
                    <li>nutrition and health projects related to food sovereignty</li>
                    <li>youth development</li>
                    <li>emergency preparedness</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our community investment projects are longer term in nature and involve tracking outcomes over a period of 6 months to 3 years.
