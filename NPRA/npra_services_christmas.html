        <p>
            For millions of Americans, the holiday season is a time of joyous celebrations filled with food, friends, and presents. For Native Americans of the Northern Plains, however, the holidays often only accentuate their daily struggles. Most find it difficult to provide even the most basic food and clothing for their families; special holiday meals and gifts are simply out of the question. 
        </p>
        <p>
            AIRC and our <a href="PageNavigator/airc_aircway">Program Partners</a> step in to make the holidays merry and bright for these deserving Native American families.  Thanks to our generous donors and an army of local volunteers, we are able to distribute some 10,000 Christmas stockings, gift bags, and fruit baskets each year.

            Each child receives a toy plus a stocking filled to the brim with gifts like mittens, pencils, crayons, coloring books, fresh fruit, and a toothbrush and toothpaste.  Every stocking bears a tag recognizing a donor who has helped make the AIRC Christmas service possible.

            Infants and teens are not overlooked, of course.  Santa's baby sacks typically include a warm blanket, a new toy, and a cuddly stuffed animal while teens welcome gifts of toiletries and skin care products.

            For the "young at heart," AIRC staff and volunteers assemble stockings for Elders containing items such as toiletries, warm socks, gloves, and a flashlight.&nbsp; Each Elder on the <a href="PageServer?pagename=airc_res_sd_rosebud">Rosebud Reservation</a> also receives a box of fresh fruit, which is a special treat in the cold winter months.
