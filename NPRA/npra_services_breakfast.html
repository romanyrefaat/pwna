            On South Dakota’s rural and remote <a href="PageNavigator/airc_res_sd_rosebud">Rosebud Reservation</a>, most Elders live at or below the poverty line. Many are homebound, because of illness or because they have no means of transportation. Facing obstacles such as these, many Elders often struggle to obtain enough food to get through the month.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nutritious food and regular meals are especially important for those with diabetes, which is prevalent among older Native Americans.&nbsp; The NPRA Breakfast-in-a-Bag service ensures that Elders age 62 and over can start each day with a healthy meal at home.&nbsp; NPRA also assists Elder Nutrition Centers, which provide free hot lunches in many communities, through the <a href="PageServer?pagename=npra_services_food">NPRA Food</a> service.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Healthy Choices</h4>
        <p>
            Once a month, Elders can use NPRA Breakfast-in-a-Bag vouchers at reservation grocery stores to choose selected healthy items at no cost. The stores post signs indicating the products available through the service, which may include eggs, sausage, bread, cereal, milk, and fruit.

            <em>Genevieve, a volunteer, has been delivering NPRA Breakfast-in-a-Bag packages to homebound Elders for many years.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            For homebound Elders, local volunteers deliver the groceries through much-needed social visits. These caring tribe members often drive long distances over poorly maintained roads during inclement weather to reach the homes of the Elders. Many of the homes are spread out over a large area, so it may take an entire day to reach each recipient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Elders sign up for the NPRA Breakfast-in-a-Bag service in January to receive groceries from February through October. The <a href="PageServer?pagename=npra_services_thanksgiving">NPRA Thanksgiving</a>&nbsp;and <a href="PageServer?pagename=npra_services_christmas">NPRA Christmas</a>&nbsp;services offer special holiday fare in November and December.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, these services provide support and encouragement to communities that are working hard to care for their Elders.

        Here are a few examples of how the NPRA Breakfast-in-a-Bag program touches the lives of Lakota Elders on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota.

        <p><em>“Right now the Breakfast-in-a-Bag that I have been receiving is nutritious foods. A lot of Elders do not get the proper foods they need. At least they get nutritious foods through Breakfast-in-a-Bag. It is an excellent program!” </em></p>

        <p><em>"Some of our Elders live on fixed incomes. After all of their living expenses are taken care of, they don't have very much left over for groceries, so the Breakfast-in-a-Bag program comes in handy...I've heard and learned about it through my relatives. Thank you for your help."</em></p>
