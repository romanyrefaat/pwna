<h1>Many American Indians work full-time yet still fall below poverty level</h1>

        <p>We fulfill our mission by working through reservation Program Partners. The goods and services we provide help these partners make things better for their people. The partners know better than we do what is needed in their communities. They know how and when goods and services need to be delivered. They know the people and their struggles, and the initiatives that are underway. So PWNA works through long-term partnerships, an approach unique among Native American-serving charities.</p>
        <p>PWNA's reservation partners are motivated and skilled but often lack the basic resources to get the job done. These partners volunteer to work with PWNA because they want to gather the resources that will empower their communities and help build capacity for the future. In doing so, they also learn how to work with outside resources, organize events, and work through volunteers. Their volunteers in turn build skills and confidence. This learning benefits the entire reservation as tribal members work together toward the common goal of self-sufficiency.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our Partners are Effective</strong><br/>
            PWNA programming is effective, according to our Program Partners. Our broad scope of services and reservation partnerships make a positive impact on the lives of the Native American people in our 11-state priority service area. We see this through our annual partner survey, partner reports, success stories, thank you letters, and our ongoing service tracking.

        <h4>Northern Plains Programs</h4>
        <p>On South Dakota's poverty-stricken Rosebud Reservation, AIRC Breakfast-in-a-Bag ensures that Elders can start each day with a healthy meal at home. The groceries typically include milk, juice, cereal, fruit, bread, potatoes, eggs, ground beef or stew meat, and sausage. One participant says:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"I really like the beef, because you can eat all day... and it really helps a lot at the end of the month."</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>For many Americans, the holiday season is a time of joy and celebration.  For Native Americans of the Northern Plains, however, special meals and presents are often unaffordable. AIRC Christmas ensures that these families can also participate in the holiday season.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>We send bountiful blessings to all those at PWNA, the sponsors, and each life you all touch in such a generous and profound way.  Merry Christmas!</p>

        <h4>Southwest Programs</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"My name is Wilson. I volunteered to help my community [the Cove Community of the Navajo Nation] pick up trash and enjoyed doing it. The incentives I earned were very useful to me. It was good exercise for me to walk the long road and it made me feel good to know the people are concerned about the nature of our community. I was surprised so many people wanted to help and I hope they will continue to keep our community clean. I thank PWNA for all the things you do for our people."</p>

        <h4>Education Program</h4>
        <p>AIEF provides school supplies for K—12 reservation students and scholarships for college-bound Native American students.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"We do want to thank you again for what you have done for us and the students here at Lodge Pole School... It's people within an organization such as yours that truly help us in promoting quality education and success for our Native American youth... You have no clue as to how much it makes our students feel better to know that they can go to school with paper for notes and schoolwork. Pencils to write with. Markers to use for creative projects or highlighting. Binders with dividers for helping them be organized. Calculators to assist them as they work through math, geometry or algebra. To know that someone or some people somewhere do care... Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for what you’ve done for these students."</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Your support makes a difference. ...Without the AIEF scholarship, I probably would not have made it through college. Now I am teaching on my reservation, and I can afford my own apartment."</p>

        <h4>Animal Rescue Program</h4>
        <p>The ROAR program was developed to increase the materials and funding available to our animal welfare partners who assist struggling animals and their caretakers with education, supplies and reduced-fee veterinary services.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"I know I do not say this often enough... THANK YOU! We are greatly appreciative for the help you give, in order that we are able to continue helping families and canines in need on the Rosebud Reservation. With deepest regards."</p>

            <p>"Elvis has left the building—again! We had adopted him in the Spring to a nice family. She lost her job, and was forced to bring him back, because she opened a day care in her home. He had adjusted well being back here, but a nice lady from Tekamah saw his picture and story and came to meet him. It was love at first site and after signing the adoption papers, Elvis said his good-byes and climbed into the car with her. She called that same night and told us that he was doing well with her other 2 female dogs. He had found the couch and making himself at home. What a good ending to a sad story. Elvis is one in a million and we are so blessed that he has a loving home"</p>
