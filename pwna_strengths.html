            <strong>PWNA strives to deliver the right goods to Partners at the right time and in the right way.</strong><br/>
            Many charities simply deliver goods to a location and leave, or "dump and run." When charities do not work repeatedly in the same communities, they may not know the adverse impact this can have. We feel this form of service is irresponsible and may create more harm than good for the community.
        </p>
        <p>The products that PWNA delivers are requested by our reservation partners. In this way, we ensure that the food is eaten, the shoes are worn, and the clothing fits. This is good stewardship. It encourages trust and future participation by Program Partners and the people they serve.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA can reach and support a wide diversity of Native American cultures.</strong><br/>
            Our trucks and services reach most of the reservations in South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and Nebraska, as well as on reservations across Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. We also have a few partners in non-priority states where our services fit the needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA is able to access isolated and remote locations that other charities cannot reach.</strong><br/>
            PWNA has an established network of more than 1,000 Program Partners who live and work in reservation communities. We also have an established inventory and logistics system and a fleet. We truck goods to the reservations 52 weeks a year, and our partners know in advance when their materials are arriving.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>When a group is selected for service, PWNA strives to serve everyone in the group.</strong><br/>
            In addition to need, a group may be further defined by age, location, the Partner’s service area, or other factors. These criteria make clear who is eligible to receive the service. Using this system helps to avoid any feeling of unfairness or partiality within the community — feelings that could undermine the effectiveness and credibility of PWNA or its Program Partners.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA adapts to the Partner's community, rather than the other way around.</strong><br/>
            Respecting the familiarity of Program Partners with the needs and people in their communities is key. Honoring the reservation programs and the goals and initiatives they have underway is equally important. PWNA strives to understand these initiatives and enhance their outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our broad scope of services helps us match the needs of most any reservation program.</strong><br/>
            We provide food to soup kitchens, till gardens for people to grow their own food, provide baby baskets to new moms in need, give Christmas presents to kids, provide school supplies, and much more. Our eight programs encompass many diverse ways to serve Native Americans.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Only PWNA has thousands of American Indian volunteers.</strong><br/>
            We understand that relief efforts succeed to the extent that the people in the community have a vested interest in them. Over 1,000 PWNA Program Partners volunteer and recruit additional volunteers to work in their communities. Native Americans also volunteer in our warehouses. Like Program Partners, these volunteers work for the good of others in their community and are provided with material goods and incentives for their efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Program Partners trust PWNA and often seek us out to volunteer.</strong><br/>
            This is a remarkable achievement. Native American communities tend to distrust charities because they sometimes deliver goods that are outdated, inferior, unneeded, or unwanted. In communities that work with PWNA, the word spreads that we can be trusted to address the need with quality products.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>PWNA helps remarkable people rise to the occasion and bring resources into their communities.</strong><br/>
            PWNA is not simply a material aid organization. We incorporate a capacity building component into every service. This ensures our Program Partners gain skills that carry over to their jobs or to other reservation projects. The reservation communities and members benefit because everyone is working toward a shared goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Passion is always in stock at PWNA.</strong><br/>
            All of our employees care about Native Americans and want to make a difference.
