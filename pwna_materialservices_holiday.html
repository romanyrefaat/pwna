            <strong>We provide holiday gift stockings for more than 50,000 children, teens and Elders during the Christmas holiday season.</strong>
        </div>
        <p>
            These stockings are filled with practical items to meet immediate needs. In addition, children and families receive incentives and prizes when they come together to participate in spring, Easter and other community gatherings. These types of holiday events also help partners and local volunteers develop skills for future event planning and community service.
