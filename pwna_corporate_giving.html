    Delta Dental of SD had given the chance for each of their employees to make a donation to the charity of their choice in the amount of $1,000.00.  This donor had recently lost her father and he had been a longtime donor of our American Indian Relief Council (AIRC) Program. She opted to make that generous donation to AIRC, which helps with services like <a href="PageServer?pagename=pwna_materialservices_food">Food and Water</a>.

            In addition to grants and products, corporations also encourage philanthropy and support employee giving. Partnership with Native Americans participates in workplace giving programs such as the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) and the State Employee Campaign (SEC), and we can establish a workplace giving campaign just for your company. Employers that are looking for a charity to adopt or a project that involves their staff in corporate social responsibility (CSR) often find an untapped interest related to Native Americans.

        <p>
            We also encourage individual employees to exercise their own “corporate social responsibility” by looking into what your employer does to support charitable endeavors. Find out whether your employer has a matching gift program to boost the impact of your personal giving. See if they participate in the CFC or SEC in your state or whether you can organize an employee giving campaign. Ask whether they’re looking for a charity to adopt or projects to sponsor, and whether they give employees time off to volunteer or conduct a drive for something like school supplies. TOMS, for instance, gives shoes for thousands of Native American children each year.
