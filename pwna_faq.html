                    PWNA is a nonprofit with eight programs for poverty-stricken reservations: American Indian Education Foundation, American Indian Relief Council, Council of Indian Nations, Navajo Relief Fund, Southwest Indian Relief Council, Sioux Nation Relief Fund, Native American Aid, and Rescue Operation for Animals of the Reservation. PWNA provides the administration, accounting, and fundraising for these programs, over and above the actual material aid, education, and relief services. PWNA is not a third party, and you may restrict your contribution to your program of choice simply by writing "Restricted" on your check or return form. This way, 100% of your donation goes to your program of choice.

                    We work with reservation programs located in our priority states when they request our services, provided their programs fit with our offerings and guidelines. We emphasize services for the most vulnerable — the Elderly and the children. Many of PWNA’s services can benefit  these populations, providing food and healthcare items to practical holiday gifts and school supplies. What we provide depends on what will meet the specific needs of each Program Partner and their community. In other words, we strive to get the right goods to the right people.

                <p>
                    The BIA reports that 90% of appropriations are expended at the local level, of which 62% are provided directly to tribes and tribal organizations through contracts, grants, and compacts — in other words 55%. These funds typically apply to infrastructure and natural resource concerns. Examples are energy and economic development, housing, irrigation and power systems, road maintenance, probate, land and records, forestry, agriculture, education, human services, justice services, range lands development, wild land fire management, water resources, and fish and wildlife management. Other monies go to running over 260 BIA offices throughout the country. It is said that barely 10 to 15 percent of BIA spending is thought to actually reach its supposed beneficiaries.

                    No. Government benefits received by Native Americans depend on many factors. Many Native Americans are veterans or disabled. Others receive social security income from years of working on the railroad, washing dishes, or waitressing. In the areas where we work, the main source of governmental aid is energy assistance and food commodities, although many Elders say it is hard for them to wade through the line to receive the commodities. There is also TANF assistance for unemployed mothers, which often requires the recipients to volunteer for 40 hours a week in a supervised program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply put, budget cutbacks and governmental policies have made it hard for many Native Americans to feed their families. With housing in disrepair and overcrowded, many Native Americans on the reservations lack any permanent address. This makes them ineligible to receive food stamps or public assistance. In remote communities, those who are able to receive food stamps frequently lack the transportation to go off the reservation and shop at a regular grocery store where they could stretch their food stamp value. In many reservation communities, there is only a convenience store where food options are limited and pricey. In these stores, the food stamps don't go very far.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    Contrary to popular belief, among the 566 tribes in the U.S., fewer than 15% operate prosperous casinos (72-74, according to the National Indian Gaming Association). PWNA serves reservations with the highest need in the U.S.  In fact, the research shows that casinos need to be within 50 miles of a metro area (with 10,000 or more residents) to be highly profitable. In our experience, the rural casinos do not have enough traffic to generate large profits — the casinos do create a few tribal jobs. Some of the tribes with profitable casinos do help other tribes, but even that is regulated by the government.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    One-third of Native Americans live on the reservations. They are free to leave the reservations, but leaving family behind is difficult for many. Family is very important to Native Americans and, for most, their reservation is "home."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leaving the reservation also means a loss of community support. Families on the reservation sometimes combine their resources in an effort to stay together. Some willing candidates are unable to leave, due to a lack of transportation. Many do leave, however, to find work or complete a college education. In turn, they help support the ones they left behind.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    Most tribes do not allow their children to be adopted outside of the tribe. The Indian Child Welfare Act expressly discourages this. Adoption is not an acceptable plan unless the child's Tribe concurs with a permanent termination of parental rights and adoption. In the case of a permanent adoption, the social worker typically looks for: 1) a member of the child's extended family, 2) other members of the child's Tribe, 3) other Indian families of similar Indian heritage, or 4) other Indian families.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children placed outside of the tribe, even in foster care, lose a sense of belonging unless they maintain their connection with their extended family, their tribe, and their caretakers. The extended family holds great importance within the Indian culture, and Indian children usually remain with one of their many grandmas.
