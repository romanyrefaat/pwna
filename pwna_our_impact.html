        <p>PWNA is — according to our Partners.</p>

        <h2>Strong Partners = Strong Reservations</h2>
        <p>
            Our constituents — the people we serve and directly impact through our work — are our reservation partners (aka Program Partners).
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of a Program Partner’s core focus (nutrition, education, health care), our main goal is to help improve reservation programs and to work to develop local leaders who can drive social change for the reservations. PWNA measures this change through partner-focused outcomes. Our partners in turn work directly with community members on client-focused outcomes, such as reducing hunger and disease rates, or increasing graduation rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            PWNA’s <a href="http://programlogicmodel.com/" target="_blank">Program Logic Model</a> shows that, as our reservation partners become more effective, they are more likely to create positive impact for their communities. The continued growth of our partners moves us toward our vision of strong, self-sufficient Native American communities.
        </p>
        <h2>Dual Focus</h2>
        <p>
            PWNA serves the immediate needs of the reservations and supports long-term solutions. To better understand how our work impacts individuals and families, we track both our long-term outcomes as well as the immediate impact made by providing materials and seasonal services.
        </p>

            <h3>Material Services</h3>
            <p>Our Material Services partners address critical needs for the Northern Plains and Southwest reservations, education and animal welfare. Working with our partners, PWNA addresses material (or humanitarian) needs  by providing products, essential supplies and seasonal services.</p>

                    Each year, PWNA sends an anonymous survey to our entire base of 1,000+ Program Partners: we want to learn about the gains they have made by working with us. Our annual survey response rate is higher than 50% and the results show that PWNA has a positive impact on our partners and their ability to better serve their communities.

            <p>PWNA’s long-term services are designed to support the self-determined initiatives of reservation partners and other local leaders who are working for sustainable gains in their communities. While our Long-Term Solutions are relatively new offerings, they are already yielding positive outcomes for partners, participants and communities on the reservations.</p>
