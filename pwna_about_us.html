            In 25 years, PWNA has evolved from a fledgling nonprofit to an organized charity with a clear mission, a passionate team and effective programs.

            Since we began focusing exclusively on the reservations, with Program Partners as trusted advisors on the needs in their communities, our evolution has been solid. Our biggest testament to this is a steady growth of Program Partners and the fact that they view PWNA as a consistent resource they can count on to be there for them.
        </p>
        <p>The road to now has been paved with many lessons and improvements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PWNA began by first providing food and then clothing. In time, we started to learn about other needs on the reservations and how to help address them.</li>
            <li>We shifted our focus from serving individuals to serving Native American reservation community-based programs (which we now call Program Partners). By doing so, we exponentially increased our reach into the communities and the number of lives we could impact.</li>
            <li>By partnering with reservation programs, we also became more familiar with the service structure on the reservations. This taught us about existing programs we could enhance and the importance of supporting local determination.</li>
            <li>Learning about the service structure also helped us identify the service gaps and create new services to help fill them. As a result, we launched many services ranging from gardening to infant care to preventative healthcare — all based on the products available to us and the services being requested by the American Indian reservation programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adding services also meant adding more reservation partners, requiring us to grow:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Early corporate donations from Matthew 25 Ministries helped PWNA grow its product availability and the number of people we could serve. Prior to this, PWNA purchased everything for cash, usually at retail prices.</li>
            <li>We grew from a rented office and storage space to two program offices with two 40,000 sf warehouses in SD and AZ. These locations make for cost-effective logistics and distribution to remote reservations most organizations cannot reach.</li>
            <li>We soon needed more equipment to warehouse and distribute goods. This took us from shopping carts and pickup truck beds to warehouse equipment, large box trucks, and semis that truck out distributions 52 weeks a year. We grew from serving the Navajo reservation and 3 Sioux reservations to serving 60 reservations a year.</li>
            <li>We also needed to develop a process for handling requests from partners, just to manage and track the new volume. With that, we also added Program Partner reporting to ensure accountability for the goods going out. These processes also cleared up any notion of PWNA being a give-away charity -- our Partners became actively involved planning, organizing and recruiting volunteers for their distributions and other activities.</li>
            <li>To maintain our high service quality to our Native American reservation partners, we began to hire specialized semi drivers, warehouse staff, outreach and support specialists, and program managers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Today, PWNA serves more than 1,000 Program Partners year-round, efficiently and cost-effectively. Our strength lies in remaining focused on effective programming and partnerships, and being a consistent resource to Indian country.
