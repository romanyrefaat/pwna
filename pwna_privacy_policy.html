        <h4>What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information:</h4>
        <p>
            Our online registration forms require donors and other users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, format preference (HTML vs. Text), physical address, interests, and similar information. Donors and other visitors who sign pledges, make donations, send eCards, or request our email or offline updates are added to our mailing list. 
            <strong>
                We do not request or store sensitive information from our online or offline donors or visitors, such as social security numbers or credit cards (unless required for a donation). For online transactions, credit card numbers and bank account (ACH) information are used only for donation processing and are not retained for any other purposes. All online transactions, including recurring donations, are managed by credit card and ACH processors.  For offline transactions, credit card numbers and bank account (ACH) information are used only for donation processing and are encrypted. PCI DSS requirements are strictly followed for online processing. 
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Partnership with Native Americans will not share, rent, or sell donor or visitor email addresses or telephone numbers with outside organizations. </strong>
            Partnership with Native Americans may occasionally share our mailing list, which includes only donor names and postal addresses, with other respected organizations. 
            <strong><em>However, if you do not want us to share your name and postal address, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@PWNAprograms.org">info@PWNAprograms.org</a> or submit this form online to let us know and we will adhere to your request. </em></strong>
            PWNA does not send mail to our donors on behalf of other organizations.
        </p>
        <h4>Internet Protocol Address:</h4>
        <p>
            We collect an IP address from all donors and other visitors to our Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track user movement throughout the site, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information. None of this IP-related information is shared with outside parties but may be seen by third-party services that help us administer and evaluate our site effectiveness.
        </p>
        <h4>Use of Cookies:</h4>
        <p>
            Our Site may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our Site. Cookies are pieces of information that some Web sites transfer to the computer being used to browse the Web site and use for record-keeping purposes. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular Web site and to ensure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard.

            Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your browser configuration (i.e., Internet settings) to refuse cookies.

        </p>
        <h4>Security:</h4>
        <p>
            All online information provided to Partnership with Native Americans is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Partnership with Native Americans. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. 
        </p>
        <h4>Tell-A-Friend:</h4>
        <p>
            If any donor or visitor elects to use our online referral service to inform a friend about our Site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Partnership with Native Americans will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. Partnership with Native Americans temporarily stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. After the email is sent, the information (friend’s name and email address) is promptly removed. 
        </p>
        <h4>Other Web Sites: </h4>
